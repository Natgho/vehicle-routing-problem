# Vehicle Routing Problem
coming soon...

## Some personal questions
1) Why vehicle capacity and jobs delivery variable types are array? (maybe related by Vroom input style)
2) (output) sample delivery duration is not correct.
3) OrTools needs to be put "depot" step. I prefer to develop my algorithm.
4) Vroom is more suitable for this question.
5) delivery duration time is a really confusing detail :)
